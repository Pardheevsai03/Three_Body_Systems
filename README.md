NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF 3-BODY DYNAMICS
IN THE PRESENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL
INTERACTIONS
The three-body issue is a mathematical model that represents the motion of three-point mass
particles in the presence of reciprocal gravitational interactions. This is a typical problem in
astrodynamics that covers a wide range of scenarios. The motion of the Moon around the
Earth under the influence of the Sun is an example of such a circumstance. Three bodies
move in space due to reciprocal gravitational interactions described by Newton's theory of
gravity in the three-body problem. To solve this difficulty, the bodies' future and previous
movements must be uniquely identified based merely on their positions.
Positions and velocities are currently being displayed. In general, body movements occur in
three dimensions (3D), with no limits on their masses or beginning circumstances. As a
result, this is known as the universal three-body issue. The intricacy of the problem does not
appear to be clear at first look, especially given that the two-body problem has well-known
closed form solutions presented in terms of elementary functions.
Adding one more body complicates the problem and makes it impossible to achieve
comparable sorts of solutions. Many physicists, astronomers, and mathematicians have tried
and failed in the past to develop closed form solutions to the three-body issue. Such solutions
do not exist since the movements of the three bodies are in general unexpected, making the
three-body issue one of the most difficult problems in scientific history.

Runge Kutta :
The Runge-Kutta method is a reliable and popular approach for resolving differential
equation initial-value issues. Without the necessity for high order derivatives of functions, the
Runge-Kutta method can be utilized to build high order accurate numerical methods by
functions alone
